*Deprecated: The `react-router` v1.x makes this obsolete, I will not maintain
this anymore.*

Fetches all data necessary for the currently active route handlers.

## Usage
When using `react-router`, it is often necessary to fetch some data
before rendering the app at a specific path.  `fetch` takes care
of exactly this.

You can use it inside of `Router.run` to fetch the data before doing the
actual rendering:

```js
import React  from 'react'
import Router from 'react-router'
import fetch  from 'fetch'

import routes from './routes'

Router.run(routes, Router.HistoryLocation, async function(Handler, state) {
  var data = await fetch(state); // wait for the fetched data
  React.render(<Handler data={data} />, document.getElementById('app'));
});
```

`fetch` goes trough all the currently activated routes and checks to
see if their handler has got a `fetchData` function set.

For instance:

```js
var Thing = React.createElement({
  statics: {
    async fetchData(params, query) {
      return api.getThing(params.id);
    }
  }

  // rest of component
});
```

## Installation
To install `fetch`:

```sh
npm i --save romeovs/fetch
```

The module is written in ES6-compliant syntax that needs to
be transpiled, you need to have [`babel`](https://babeljs.io) installed
on your system before installing it.  If you don't have it, the above command
will fail.  To fix this, do:

```sh
npm install --global babel
```

## Todo
  - write tests
  - add session/authentication support?
